#Pet Adoption System – Core Java Project

A simple and interactive Pet Adoption System built using Core Java and strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
This project allows users to add pets, view available pets, and adopt pets through a clean, menu-driven console interface.

I practiced and implemented Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, and ArrayLists, applying real-world logic using Java fundamentals. 💻✨
